This is my repo for assignments related to the Embedded Systems course.

I have moved the files related to assignments of Module 1 to m1, Module 2 to m2, etc. This is done so that I don't have to maintain separate git repositories for each assignment, since I am pushing to a remote repo to save my work. (Keeping separate git repos for each assignment locally will require me to push to separate remote repos, unless I use subtrees or subrepos or submodules, which are all too complicated for this purpose.)

Since I need to submit my assignment as a zip which contains the .git folder, I will do it at the top-level (i.e. including all folders like m1, m2, etc.).

If you are peer-reviewing my work, first `cd` to the relevant folder after unzipping, please.
