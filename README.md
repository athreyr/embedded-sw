## How to use

From the directory where this README file exists, do `cd course1/` and run `make build` at the command line. Other commands (build targets) can be seen from the `Makefile` documentation.

There are two undefined macros in the implementation file `course1.c` shared by the instructor, `BASE_10` and `BASE_16`. I have not modified the instructor's file, but defined these macros in the target recipe instead.
